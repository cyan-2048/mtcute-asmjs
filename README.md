# mtcute-asmjs

@mtcute/wasm converted to asm.js for KaiOS 2.5

libwebp is also added for webp support on KaiOS 2.5, feel free to remove it if you don't need it.

You might need to clone a specific commit of [libwebp](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/tree/04834acae7aaff14eb5af794174bce0d158c40fc)

You also need to install an older version of emscripten: https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/18013
